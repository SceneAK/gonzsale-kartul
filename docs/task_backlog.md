## Important
- SSL Certificates
- Catpcha V2

## orders
. Mailing Customers when order status changes, when product gets deleted 

## Request Home page Items (promotional content)
- Design the system

## Preorder specific data
- Make frontend tell you if it's preorder

## OAuth2

## users
- change password

## Refactor
- Rethink route file structure? It feels overcomplicated / weird
DONE (kindof) Move logic that creates circular dependency to OrderManagementServices: orderItemServices.UpdateStatus + orderServices.createOrder()

## Extended Less Important Backlog
- Statistical Analysis for Seller Account
- Implement propper signout & blacklisting 
- Payment Gateway
DONE Use paranoid delete

# Security Concerns & Abuse Protection
- Limit number of variants
- Express-Rate-Limiter
- Cors check reconfig
// todo: check if user has association with the order
